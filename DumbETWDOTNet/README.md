# DumbETWDotNETRuntime

This is a "separate" project which monitors the .NET Runtime. I extended the code a bit (in a really dirty way :D) to include the assembly name in the real-time mode. 
That way, you can now test if your ETW bypass works by launching a .NET assembly and checking if the name appears in the trace. 

GL & have fun !
